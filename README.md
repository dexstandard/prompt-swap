# prompt-swap

Prompt Swap is a playground for experimenting with AI‑assisted crypto trading
agents. Users write natural‑language prompts that describe a strategy, and an
OpenAI model plans token swaps accordingly. Trades execute on Binance using the
user's encrypted API keys. A Fastify backend schedules agents and records
results while a React dashboard lets users manage agents and inspect their
activity.

## User flow

1. Sign in with Google and add your Binance API key pair.
2. Create an agent by choosing a token pair, setting a spend limit, and writing
   a prompt that explains how the agent should trade.
3. The scheduler periodically loads active agents, plans a swap with OpenAI,
   simulates the trade, executes it on Binance, and stores the outcome and model
   logs.
4. Use the dashboard to review trades, inspect prompt/response logs, or pause
   and delete agents.

## Features

- Encrypted storage of Binance API keys secured with a user password.
- Allow‑listed token pairs and trade limits to reduce risk.
